This enhanced binding capability may result in higher transmissibility, though current data doesn't indicate increased disease severity. Existing vaccines should remain effective, but monitoring is recommended.",
        "H1N1": "This hemagglutinin mutation alters the surface proteins that are primary targets for antibodies. The change may result in partial immune escape from antibodies generated by previous infections or vaccinations, potentially reducing population immunity by 15-20%."

    "technical": {
        "SARS-CoV-2": "The N501Y substitution in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein enhances ACE2 binding affinity through formation of a novel π-stacking interaction with Y41 of ACE2, resulting in ~7-fold increased binding affinity. Cryo-EM structures indicate conformational stabilization of the up-state RBD, potentially explaining the observed 35-45% increase in transmission efficiency. Neutralization assays with convalescent sera show only marginal (1.5-fold) reduction in neutralization titers.",
        "H1N1": "This K163Q substitution in the Sa antigenic site of hemagglutinin introduces a polar residue that disrupts recognition by strain-specific antibodies targeting the 159-169 epitope region. Hemagglutination inhibition assays demonstrate a 4-8 fold reduction in neutralization by monoclonal antibodies targeting this region, while maintaining similar receptor binding properties to wild-type virus."

## Executive Summary
This plan outlines a comprehensive strategy to contain the {virus} outbreak in {region} over the next {timeframe} days, protecting a population of {population}.

## Current Situation Assessment
- Confirmed cases: {cases}
- Growth rate: {growth_rate}% daily
- Healthcare capacity: {icu_capacity} ICU beds, currently at {current_occupancy}% occupancy
- Testing capacity: {current_testing} tests per day

## Strategic Objectives
1. Reduce transmission rate by 50% within 14 days
2. Prevent healthcare system overwhelm
3. Minimize economic and social disruption
4. Protect vulnerable populations

## Intervention Phases

### Phase 1: Immediate Containment (Days 1-7)
- **Testing Strategy**: Increase to {enhanced_testing} tests daily, prioritizing symptomatic cases and contacts
- **Contact Tracing**: Deploy {contact_tracers} tracers, aim for 90% contact identification within 24 hours
- **Healthcare Preparedness**: Increase hospital capacity by {capacity_increase}%, prepare surge facilities
- **Community Measures**: Mask requirements in public spaces, limit gatherings to {gathering_limit} people

### Phase 2: Sustained Response (Days 8-21)
- Evaluate transmission data and adjust measures accordingly
- Implement targeted interventions in high-transmission areas
- Begin vaccination campaign if vaccines available
- Support affected businesses and vulnerable populations

### Phase 3: Recovery Planning (Days 22-30)
- Develop criteria for scaling back emergency measures
- Prepare long-term surveillance system
- Evaluate need for booster vaccinations or updated vaccines
- Document lessons learned for future preparedness

## Resource Requirements
- Personnel: {personnel_needed} (healthcare, public health, support services)
- Funding: ${funding_needed} million
- Equipment: {ppe_needed} PPE units, {ventilators_needed} ventilators
- Facilities: {isolation_beds} isolation beds, {quarantine_capacity} quarantine spaces

## Coordination Framework
- Unified command structure between health department, emergency management, and healthcare systems
- Daily coordination calls with regional and national authorities
- Weekly public briefings
- Bi-weekly evaluation of strategy effectiveness

This plan should be implemented immediately and reviewed daily based on epidemiological indicators.
